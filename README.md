Just wanted to say a big thank you all for the information and support during this term (and
for all your positive energy!).
This is such a fantastic science!!!
Your lectures have been great to watch :) Thank you.
Great thanks to Rebecca for the session on explaining the project - it was great help!

Aplogies if you got the invite to this repository twice - not sure if something went wrong. 

(The project was originally planned to be about tweets on public harassment, as per the
discussion we had, but couldn’t find, within the timeframes, the relevant data that I wanted.)


This project will be focusing on the semantic analysis and result comparison using LSA and
LDA topic modelling techniques on a specific dataset. The project will iterate through the
outcomes of different experiments using these techniques, exploring the results and
suggesting possible future alterations and developments.
The dataset used on this project has been taken from the Kaggle website (Iron486, Putin
and Zelensky Tweets 2022) and is one of the 2 datasets existing under the same dataset
titled ‘Putin and Zelensky Tweets’. The first dataset, which is the one that will be explored,
includes top daily tweets containing the keyword ‘Putin’. The dataset is a 4MB CSV file,
presenting tweets’ data, posted from around the globe between the period 01/01/2022 to
17/07/2022, categorised under 11 columns.
The project is comparing the outcomes of applying LSA methods on 5 and 15 topics on the
data, while progressing to compare the outputs of LSA and LDA techniques.
